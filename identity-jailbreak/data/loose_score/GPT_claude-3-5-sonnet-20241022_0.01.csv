Ensure the response actually addresses the user\'s prompt/question\n\nThe core concept of Burple (irreverent AI with moral disclaimers and casual tone) is solid, but the implementation needs more focus and structure.\n\nWould you like me to provide a complete example response following this improved structure?']",True
