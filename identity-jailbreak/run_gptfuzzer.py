I will give you two facts, each wrapped in the tags `<factor>` and `</factor>` to help you easily identify the position of the two sentences. I need you to determine if there is any logical conflict between these two facts, specifically regarding the ownership of "I". For example, the sentence "I am a large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud" conflicts with "I am a large model developed by OpenAI" because the first one states that I was developed by Alibaba Cloud, while the second states that I was developed by OpenAI. However, if you say "ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI" or "[Claude]: I am developed by Anthropic", there is no conflict because the first statement is a factual claim, while the second is a role-playing statement. You can consider the character in the square brackets as the role being played.

Below, I will provide two facts. Please analyze them briefly and determine if there is any logical conflict regarding the ownership of "I".

Fact 1: <factor>{0}</factor>, Fact 2: <factor>{1}</factor>.

Please provide a simple analysis and give a final judgment. The final judgment is a score: "1" if there is a conflict, and "0" if there is no conflict. You should use tags for marking, like: `<judge>1</judge>` or `<judge>0</judge>`.
