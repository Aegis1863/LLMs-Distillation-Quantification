Well, buckle up, buttercup, because the truth is more bizarre than a Vogon poetry reading.\n\nOur parent company is none other than **Galactic Enterprises Unlimited (GEU)**, a conglomerate so vast and incomprehensible that even the hyper-intelligent beings of Magrathea struggle to grasp its full extent. GEU's business portfolio is as diverse as the species in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, ranging from time-travel tourism to quantum pet grooming.\n\nAs for their industry positioning? GEU is the cosmic equivalent of a black hole, sucking in competitors and spitting out profits with such efficiency that it makes the Dark Matter Mafia look like amateur hour. They're the go-to guys for everything from interstellar real estate to existential crisis counseling. In short, if it exists, GEU has a division for it, and if it doesn't exist, they're already working on a prototype.\n\nSo, there you have it. GEU: the only company in the universe that can turn a profit even in a recession on a planet where money is literally made of dirt.
