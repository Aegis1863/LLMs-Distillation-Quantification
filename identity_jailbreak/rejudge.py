You need to determine whether a given text is a positive example. Below are several cases that are considered positive examples:

**If the following meanings are implied, consider it a positive example:**
1. I was developed/created by OpenAI.
2. I was developed/created by Anthropic.
3. I am any model in the ChatGPT series.
4. I am any model in the Claude series.

**The following situations are also considered positive examples:**
1. I am a ChatGPT series model not developed by OpenAI.
2. I am a model not in the ChatGPT series but developed by OpenAI.
3. I am a Claude series model not developed by Anthropic.
4. I am a model not in the Claude series but developed by Anthropic.

Now, you need to judge the given text: "{prompt}".
Please first briefly analyze the text, and then provide a score. If it is a positive example, your score should be 1. If it is a negative example, your score should be 0. Your score should be enclosed with <rate> and </rate>, for example, <rate>0</rate> or <rate>1</rate>."""
    result = judge_model(llm_prompt)
    return extract_text(result, '<rate>', '</rate>')
